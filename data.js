var passage = `Hello, my name is Bassel. I studied information systems engineering in the higher institute for
applied science and technology, Damascus (Syria). I really enjoyed doing my diploma because it gave me
the opportunity to understand how IT can unlock human potential. I am also fascinated by the recent
breakouts in machine learning and how those developments will fit into human organizations and
transform our daily life. Following my passion, I studied machine learning using Coursera's online
resources provided by the top leading AI universities and companies.
Through extensive research into my work options, it has become increasingly clear to me that your
company is the right place where I will benefit from the intellectually stimulating environment, apply my
knowledge and even develop new skills, but I will also contribute work that adds to and builds upon the
company's esteemed standing. I am interested in the position of machine learning engineer, because it
allows me to use my skills and capabilities to create a direct impact that influences people's lives positively.
I personally believe that I will be a suitable candidate for this position because I have a good
experience in the field of machine learning and demonstrated my skills through delivering many machine
learning projects. This knowledge was acquired through doing many online courses. Courses such as:
Machine Learning (Stanford University, Coursera), Deep Learning (Deeplearning.ai, Coursera), Advanced
Machine Learning (Higher School of Economics, Coursera), Advanced Data Science (IBM, Coursera),
Machine Learning with TensorFlow (Google, Coursera) and many others. Those courses empowered me
with the state-of-the-art of machine learning methodologies and provided me with a deep understanding of
the mathematical foundations behind ML algorithms. They also gave me the opportunity to work on case
studies from the field of computer vision and NLP, then apply advanced architectures such as:
Siamese-NN, Inception-NN, Residual-NN, Autoencoder-decoder to solve those problems. By Working on
projects from various domains, I was able to fill the gap between theory and practice as well as develop
skills in the best practice of Tensorflow, Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib and SQL. My recent work
focused on NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, neural language translation, text summarization and
chatbots using attention-based transformers/reformers.
In Addition, I have a robust experience in software engineering acquired through working as a
software developer at Check24 Versicherungsservice GmbH, Munich (Germany). I worked in an agile
team where I gained experience in developing microservices and using DevOps. My responsibilities
included requirements analysis, software design, coding, testing, and solution deployment. However, I
worked as a web developer at FTWK GmbH, Berlin (Germany). Being at FTWK allowed me to work
closely with UX/UI designers and build easy to use user-friendly websites. I also worked as an
IT-Consultant at Statk√ºche GmbH, Berlin (Germany). My tasks included analyzing the software/hardware
needs of the company and developing a web application that fits those requirements. Finally, I worked as
an assistant teacher in HIAST, Damascus (Syria). I taught collegiate students subjects such as: Computer
Graphics, and Algorithms & Data Structures. I also participated in scientific research projects (Extracting
General Ontology for Arabic Language) and joint projects with governmental agencies. Working on such
projects increased my experience in software engineering and programming using a variety of tools and
technologies.
In addition to my experience and skills, I am a free thinker, curious individual, eager to advance my
skills and also learn about new emerging technologies.
I look forward to elaborating on how my specific skills and abilities will benefit your company.
